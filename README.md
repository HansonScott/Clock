# Overview
This clock project is a simple solution to a clear problem.  It is a desktop application that shows the machine time in real time in a much larger font and can be dragged anywhere on the (or any) screen.

# Background
When using multiple monitors, sometimes the standard windows clock gets hidden by full screen applications (games).  I also run at a pretty high res, so the clock is quite small.  I wanted a nice big one that I could move around as desired.  Being a developer, the solution is to write one!  Initially took me about 5 minutes to write, and now I'm starting to add bells and whistles to it just for fun.

# Features
* Pulls from the local machine clock
* Updates every second on a timer

# Future plans
* color picker for background and text
* font resizing with window resizing
